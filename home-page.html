            <p>Hi, I'm Zeke Hart, a (formerly) self-taught software developer. I've done web development for several institutions over the last decade including a handful of projects at UNC. Most recently I have been managing a Software as a Service company the sells two Django web apps. In working with these I realized that my knowledge only scratched the surface of the things a developer could do so I went back to school and am enjoying exploring the world of software development in a more formal, thorough, and structured setting.</p>
            <p>Looking towards the future I am planning on completing this immersive development class I am taking and taking my next step in the world of software development. I am fascinated by how things work underneath the surface, and am particularly interested in responsive and predictive elements of webpages and user interaction. </p>
            <p>Here on my website you can find some information about me, projects I have completed, my resume and my contact information. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.</p>
